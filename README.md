# EntityLinkingRetrieval-ELR for PyLucene 6
A slightly modified version of EntityLinkingRetrieval-ELR that works for PyLucene 6  

Original version: https://github.com/hasibi/EntityLinkingRetrieval-ELR

Mainly rewrite some functions in nordlys/retrieval/lucene_tools.py  

Only works for index of original version. If you want to create your own index by Pylucene 6, use term vector to store value instead of textfield (or you can rewrite some functions in lucene_tools.py to support lucene 6 fields).
